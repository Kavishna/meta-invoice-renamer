# Meta Invoice Renamer

I came across this project on Upwork and decided to give it a shot. Here are the job requirements as provided by the client.

> Every month we have Meta (Facebook) invoices as attached. I would like to extract the reference number (f.ex. PJ2LSNBAB2 in the attached file) and rename the file with it.
>
> I should be able to insert a batch of invoices and get all renamed files back.
>
> In the end, the script should be easily usable by a non-programmer.

Here's the attachment,with confidential details blacked out to maintain privacy.
